# ZooKeeper
A simple app using AngularJS, UI-Router, and a Spring Boot REST Api to track animals, their cages, and their foods.

Start a new Postgres database called finalprojectzoo, and restore the database from the .backup file found in 
this repository. 

Import the project as a maven project, and run as usual.
